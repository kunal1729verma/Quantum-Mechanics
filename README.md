# Lecture Notes
This repository hosts lecture notes and revision sheets (and some other helpful resources) for various courses that I've taken during my Physics Major at IISER Mohali. There is a possibility of various mistakes and typos that I might have made in the notes, and they do not reflect on the taught material in any way.

**Some general resources**
* Green's functions and method of images [(https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09999)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09999)
* Andrew Lucas' Old Problem Collection [(Webpage)](https://www.alucasphys.com/problems.html)
* gradschoolproblemscollection [(link)](https://github.com/kunal1729verma/lecture_notes_physics_iiserm/gradschoolproblemcollection.zip) (I don't remember where I found this document. Please let me know if you happen to know the original source/author)
