These notes contain multiple typos and errors (especially the section on s-wave superconductivity and its mean field theory analysis) and are only good for getting an idea of the sort of content followed in a Quantum Phase Transitions course. I will (hopefully) be fixing these typos in the near future, but till then, please use other resources to verify and cross-check the calculations and expressions.
